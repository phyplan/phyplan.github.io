        <p>
          Given the task of positioning a ball-like object to a goal region beyond direct reach, humans can often throw, slide, or rebound objects against the wall to attain the goal. However, enabling robots to reason similarly is non-trivial. Existing methods for physical reasoning are data-hungry and struggle with complexity and uncertainty inherent in the real world. This paper presents PhyPlan, a novel physics-informed planning framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable embodied agents to perform dynamic physical tasks. PhyPlan leverages PINNs to simulate and predict outcomes of actions in a fast and accurate manner and uses MCTS for planning. It dynamically determines whether to consult a PINN-based simulator (coarse but fast) or engage directly with the actual environment (fine but slow) to determine optimal policy. Given an unseen task, PhyPlan can infer the sequence of actions and learn the latent parameters, resulting in a generalizable approach that can rapidly learn to perform novel physical tasks. Evaluation with robots in simulated 3D environments demonstrates the ability of our approach to solve 3D-physical reasoning tasks involving the composition of dynamic skills. Quantitatively, PhyPlan excels in several aspects: (i) it achieves lower regret when learning novel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art, (ii) it expedites skill learning and enhances the speed of physical reasoning, (iii) it demonstrates higher data efficiency compared to a physics un-informed approach.

          <b>PhyPlan pipeline:</b> Clockwise from top. (1) The robot learns a model of physical skills such as hitting, swinging, sliding etc. using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The network incorporates a coarse physics governing equation in its loss function and can predict the future trajectory of the interacting object as well as the latent physical parameters of the domain. Given a new task (2), a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (3) searches for a plan by exploring the space of skill compositions, i.e., sampling over continuous parameters e.g., the height of object release, the angle of a wedge with which the object may collide. Simulating the trajectories during physical interaction using a forward pass of a PINN is faster than simulating rich inter-object dynamic interactions in a high-fidelity physics simulator (with complex physical models). The MCTS plan search (4) periodically balances sampling with the PINNs with occasional rollouts in the high-fidelity simulator. The discrepancy in the reward between (i) predicted by PINN rollouts and rollout in the physics simulator is modelled using a Gaussian Process (GP) that guides the MCTS towards the correct plan.

          We consider the problem of learning a model for physical skills such as bouncing a ball-like object off a
          wedge, sliding over an object, swinging a pendulum, throwing an object as a projectile and hitting an object
          with a pendulum.

          We created the following four challenging 3D physical reasoning tasks to analyse the performance of PhyPlan,
          inspired by prior works in simplistic 2D environments presnted in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09620"
            class="external-link is-normal">[Allen et al., 2020]</a> and <a href="https://phyre.ai/"
            class="external-link is-normal">[Bakhtin et al., 2019]</a>.
          PhyPlan performs semantic reasoning using PINN-based Skill Models before executing each action in the
          environemnt (just as Humans think before executing). It also learns the difference between PINN-based rewards
          for actions and actual rewards as it executes actions (called online learning). Therefore, it often improves
          in subsequent actions (Just as Humans improve their actions with more trials). The videos show the actions
          taken by PhyPlan on each task. The effect of online learning is more evident in Bounce and Bridge tasks where
          the robot fails to perform well in early attempts.

              Over the shown trials, the robot learns to correctly align the pendulum so that the hitting plane is
              correctly aligned. Eventually, the robot effectively uses objects like the bridge present in the
              environment.

        <em>Initial Prompt (Task Description):</em>
        <div class="columns is-centered is-vcentered"></div>
<pre><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is a robot and a goal located at {goal_pos} outside the direct reach of the robot. There is a ball that needs to reach the goal. The environment has a fixed pillar over which the ball is resting, and a pendulum hanging over the ball that the robot can orient to hit the ball to throw it to the goal. The robot can orient the pendulum along any vertical plane and choose to drop the pendulum from any angle from the vertical axis. When hit with a pendulum, the puck projectiles and lands far away on the ground.
Sanity check 1: How does the plane of the pendulum affect the puck's position with respect to the goal?
Sanity check 2: How does the drop angle of the pendulum affect the puck's position with respect to the goal?

        <em>Feedback Prompt:</em>

<pre><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In one line, give the numerical values of the angle to orient the pendulum's plane and the angle to drop the pendulum from (both in decimal radians). The bound for plane orientation angle is ({bnds[0][0]}, {bnds[0][1]}) and that for drop angle with vertical axis is ({bnds[1][0]}, {bnds[1][1]}). I will tell you where the ball landed, and you should modify your answer accordingly till the ball reaches the goal. I have marked the ground into two halves. The goal lies in one half, and the robot and the wedge are at the centre. Thoughout the conversation, remember that my response would be one of these:
  1. The ball lands in the half not containing goal, I'd say 'WRONG HALF'.
  2. The ball lands in the correct half but left of the goal, I'd say 'LEFT by &lthorizontal distance between ball and goal&gt'.
  3. The ball lands in the correct half but right of the goal, I'd say 'RIGHT by &lthorizontal distance between ball and goal&gt'.
  4. The ball lands in the correct half and in line but overshot the goal, I'd say 'OVERSHOT by &lthorizontal distance between ball and goal&gt'.
  5. The ball lands in the correct half and in line but fell short of the goal, I'd say 'FELL SHORT by &lthorizontal distance between ball and goal&gt'.
  6. Finally, the ball successfully landed in the goal, I'd say 'GOAL'. \
Note: In your response, do not write anything else except the (pendulum's plane angle, pendulum's drop angle) pair. Send in tuple FORMAT: (angle 1, angle 2). Do not emphasise the answer, just return plain text. Let's begin with an initial guess!
